# PhoneBook

In this project I used javaFX to create a GUI for the application.
The application enables the user to add contacts to the list, save it to a database, and export the saved contacts to a pdf file.
(This project was created based on the youtube video series called "San Franciscoból jöttem -Java FX".)
